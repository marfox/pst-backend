            100x more than the default form size limit - our updates are
            reasonably large and it isn't worth breaking them up. Hopefully.

            Setting maxFormContentSize via configuration of the system
            properties on the jetty-maven-plugin does not work (or at least I
            don't understand how to make it work). Configuring it via jetty.xml
            works, so let's use that for the moment.
